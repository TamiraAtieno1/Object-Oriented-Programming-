# Structural Modelling 

- Towards the end of the analysis phase, functional models representing how the system will behave were created
- During the design phase, we need to understand how the system will be organized
- This organization defines the structure of the system

### Structural Models
- A structural model is a formal way of representing the organization of ideas or concepts in an information system
- It also includes how these ideas or concepts are related to one another
- It can be ‘abstract’, that is, it is not tied to any specific implementation
- It can be ‘concrete’, that is, it is tied to a specific implementation
  The decision of whether to have an abstract or concrete model depends on what is needed 
- Structural modeling also helps create a vocabulary that can be used by the analyst and the users to communicate effectively
- Structural models represent the things, ideas, or concepts contained in the domain of the problem
- They also represent the relationships among the things, ideas, or concepts

### Structural Models Diagrams
- There are a number of Structural UML diagrams or models
Below are UML structural models:
  Class diagrams
  Object diagrams
  Deployment diagrams
  Package diagrams
  Composite structure diagram
  Component diagram

### Class Diagrams
The class diagram is the most widely used structural diagram
- Class diagrams are best suited for modeling object oriented concepts
- They are used to describe the types of objects in a system and their relationships
- Class diagrams are composed of classes, attributes, methods, associations, messages and multiplicity

### The process of drawing class diagrams
To be able to draw a class diagram, one should follow the steps below:
Identify the system that is to be modeled Eg, library system
Identify all the objects in the system
Add attributes to the objects identified
Add the object methods, multiplicity and relationships between the objects
NB: If you struggle too hard to come up with useful attributes or methods for an object, then perhaps the object chosen is not a useful one
