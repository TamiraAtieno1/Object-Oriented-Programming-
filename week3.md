# Behavioral Modelling

## Introduction

- Behavioral Modelling will be needed at some pont as we move through the SDLC phases

### SDLC phases
1.System Planning

2.System Analysis

3.System Design 

4.System Implementation

### 1. System Planning
- It establishes project scope, goals, schedule, and budget
- System requirements lack a lot of planning as the projct has just began

### 2. System Analysis
- A more thorough and detailed understanding of the system is undertaken
- This is done using requirements-gathering techniques such as interviewing, JAD, observation etc
- Using these techniques, the analyst determines the requirements and creates a requirements definition which defines what the sys should do.

### System Analysis-part2
- Onc requirements are understood the system is modelled in terms of a diagram
- A use case diagram popular modlling diagram used to depict the behavior of the system.
- Function : It provides a simplified graphical representation of what the system must actually do
- It's part of the UML modelling diagrams

## Unified Modelling Language UML
- It standard visual modeling language
- UML modeling diagrams are used to to help document and organize system requirements
- It is used in the analysis, design, and implementation of software-based systems
- It has a different modelling diagrams each suited at modelling specific parts of a system
- Examples of UML diagrams include: use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc.
- One of the best software available for drawing UML diagrams is Visual Paradigm

## Use Case Analysis
-One of the biggest benefits of the use-case diagram is that its simplistic nature makes it easily understandable by non-IT project stakeholders
### Functions
- The purpose of the use case diagrams is to simply provide a high level view of the system and convey the requirements in layman's terms to the stakeholders
- Additional diagrams and documentation can be used to provide a complete functional and technical view of the system

## Use case Modelling
- Use-case modeling is an approach that facilitates and encourages user involvement
- It has it's roots in object orinted modelling
- Concieved in 1986
- Use cases are initiated or triggered by users called actors
- An actor does not have to be human
- An actor can be
  An organization, 
  another information system, 
  an external device, 
  the concept of time.

## Elements of Use case Modelling
- The elements of a use-case diagram include:
   - actors, 
   - use cases, 
   - subject boundaries, 
   - relationships between actors, 
   - relationships between actors and use cases,
   - Relationships between use cases
- These relationships consist of association, include, extend, and generalization relationships
