# Behavioral Modelling

## Introduction

- Behavioral Modelling will be needed at some pont as we move through the SDLC phases

### SDLC phases
1.System Planning

2.System Analysis

3.System Design 

4.System Implementation

### 1.System Planning
- It establishes project scope, goals, schedule, and budget
- System requirements lack a lot of planning as the projct has just began

### 2.System Analysis
- A more thorough and detailed understanding of the system is undertaken
- This is done using requirements-gathering techniques such as interviewing, JAD, observation etc
- Using these techniques, the analyst determines the requirements and creates a requirements definition which defines what the sys should do.
